2. Navigate to the Raycast Store to Download the `Gitpod` extension
3. While generating the GitHub Access Token, make sure to give the `user`, `admin` & `repo` access rights, else it may result in some weird behaviours.
4. For directly opening the workspaces and interaction with Gitpod, you'll need a Gitpod Access Token which is currently in beta and available for limited users, if you have a github access token, navigate to command setting by using `cmd` + `,` and set the access token there.
